## Hello there!
👋 Hi, I’m Cesar Torres {@CESARIUX2596}, a Machine Learning Engineer with an academic background in computer science (MSc. in Soft Computing) and a passion for Deep Learning and Linux. I am currently pursuing a ScD in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) and am looking for industry experience and opportunities to collaborate on new publications in the field.
<br/>
Some of my interest are:
- 🎸 
- 🏎️
- 💻
- 🎮
- 🍳

### Currently working on:
- Generative AI (LLMs, Diffusion Models, GANs).
- Edge Computing.
- Fuzzy Image Processing.
- Visual Transformers.
- Multimodal Learning.
- Self Hosted Services.
- Cool stuff under an NDA 🤫.
