## Hello there!

I'm **Cesar Torres** {@CESARIUX2596}, an AI researcher and software engineer with a strong academic and industry background in computer science. I hold an MSc in Soft Computing and a BSc in Computer Science, and I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Machine Learning with a focus on **Generative AI**.

🔬 I currently work at **Thermo Fisher Scientific** as a Software Developer, where I contribute to the **Gene AI Platform**, an internal LLM-based solution hosted on Azure. Previously, I worked at **Samsung Research Tijuana**, building proof-of-concept CV/NLP systems for edge deployment.

I'm passionate about **deep learning**, **Linux**, and building AI tools that make a difference. Always open to **industry collaborations** and **research publications**.
